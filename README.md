### About the Experiment 

In this experiment, we examine the impact of several welding parameters, such as welding current, speed, and voltage. These variables control the heat input rate, which melts the base metal and filler wire. The effect of weld parameters on the size and geometry of the weld bead will be studied in this experiment.
